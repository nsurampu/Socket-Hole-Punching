### A report by Kaustubh Welankar, Basu Dubey, Naren Surampudi, Chandrahas Aroori


## Introduction 

**Dropbox** is a file hosting service launched in 2007. It is used in many organisations as well as by individuals for their data storage needs. Dropbox is available as a web based service, where users can upload their files and view them, or as a native client, where files are synced automatically. Native clients are available for Windows, MacOS, Linux based PCs, and apps are available for Android and iOS.
 
The current DropBox LAN implementation is restriced by ***subnetting***. The current project attempts to build an application that helps overcome the subnetting problem, as well as build a system for managing it within a distributed system.
